Go Programming Notes

## General Program Structure Things
- Each program is organized into packages (modules or libraries)
- A package consists of one or more *.go* source files that tell the program what to do (contain the logic).
- Each .go file begins with a package declaration that indicates which package the file belongs to, followed by a list of other packages that it imports and then declarations of the program are stored in that file.
- The Go standard library contains over 100 packages for common tasks such as input and output, sorting and text manipulation.

  ```go fmt``` for instance contains functions for printing formatted output and scanning input.
